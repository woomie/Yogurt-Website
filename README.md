# Yogurt-Website
I am re-creating a static website to test my knowledge of HTML and CSS and the one thing I had an issue with has been the positioning of objects on the website, I know Flex box, Grid and bootstrap but I still struggle with centering a div. Hopefully with more practice I can accomplish this.
